In the Simulation.Rmd, we give the code of our paper in R.

The three experiments use the same code, to implement different senerios, just need to change the value of m and N in the first block (lines 18-42) and the result tables in the sixth block (lines 168-194).

The code block 3 (lines 75-125) is the procedure to get the confidence intervals. This will take a lot of time to run, so we provide the results table. You can skip running this code block and just run the following blocks using the given table.

The results table simulated_Lower.txt and simulated_Upper.txt are the lower bound and upper bound table when m=30, N=10.

The results table simulated_Lower2.txt and simulated_Upper2.txt are the lower bound and upper bound table when m=50, N=30.

The results table simulated_Lower3.csv and simulated_Upper3.csv are the lower bound and upper bound table when m=50, N=100.
